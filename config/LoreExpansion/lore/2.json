    "body":"Oreberry bushes can grow oreberries. These can be smelted into ingots.
	To plant them, you need to make a dark room like you would make for mushrooms.
	You can plant them on any solid block, like the Redstone. The darker it is, the faster it will grow.
	The plant first undergoes 3 stages of growth. When it reached its maximum size (a full block) it will start to grow the berries.
	You can simply harvest them by right-clicking the bush.",
